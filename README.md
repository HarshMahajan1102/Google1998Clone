# Google1998Clone
I have used the references from w3schools and geeksforgeeks to add fonts and also for certain size editing.
I didnt used the same font as it was difficult to find the same but choose the similar ones.
It's just the front end part so no need to run it.

Also a problem I faced is, though I use the same rgb values from colour picker, the colour in the original one and in my project seems different 
and I have no idea about that, why its happening like this.
